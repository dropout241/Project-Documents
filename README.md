## Background
Much of professional software development involves adding features to existing applications or working within the constraints provided by the company you work for. Such an environment can be limiting as essential software development concepts are abstracted from you and your experience my vary. Concepts like network protocols, front-end development, NoSql datastores, Load balancing, etc are abstracted away from me. This projects serves as a means to do the following:

1. Learn about a variety of new technologies that are industry relevant.
2. Apply concepts and learnings that i wouldnt otherwise be able to.
3. Build something extensible and relevant to my current work/interests.
